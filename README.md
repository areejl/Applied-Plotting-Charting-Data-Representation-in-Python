# Applied-Plotting-Charting-Data-Representation-in-Python
This project requires that you to find at least two datasets on the web which are related, and that you visualize these datasets to answer a question with the broad topic of weather phenomena  What do we mean by weather phenomena? For this category you might want to consider seasonal changes, natural disasters, or historical trends.



Project requirement 
## State the region and the domain category that the data sets are about 
United States , Weather

## Research question about the domain category and region 
Was snowfall and rainfall responsible for the temperature change in the United States?

## Two links to publicly accessible datasets

## justification
The figure above shows the snowfall and rainfall effect temperatures in the United States.
In accordance with the above-mentioned URL, I plotted the trend. As a result, I had gone through
After parsing the CSV files obtained from the websites, I plotted the data and tried to make it as accurate as possible. I plotted it accurately without mismatches or truncations.

## Cairoâ€™s principles
- Truthfulness: The snowfall and rainfall label has been edited to show that it's (in 0.1*m) and the temperature in Celsius
- Beauty: The colorblind palette has been used to aid colorblind readers in reading the visualization and The wave charting technique.
- Functionality: The wave charting technique that I select is appropriate for the dataset, and I complete the analysis. In addition to functionality, the design should be eye-catching to the user.
- Insightfulness: This has been shown by marking Snowfall in blue, Rainfall in Pink, and temperature in orange respectively.
